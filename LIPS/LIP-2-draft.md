**Simple Summary**
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the LIP.-->
This LIP proposal if very simple in nature. The proposal is that a basic feature addition should be made to the wallet software. It is proposed that the ability to export the transaction history in CSV format should be added to the Loki wallets. The exportable data should include all possible data for each transaction associated with a given public address; the hash, amount, sent/received, date, etc.

**Motivation for LIP**
<!--The motivation is critical for LIPs that want to change the Loki or Lokinet protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the LIP solves. LIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
Motivation for this LIP is straight forward. Users desire the ability to export their transaction history in a format that will allow them to make further use of all information revolving around their transactional use of the Loki cryptocurrency.

**Technical Specifications**
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations of Loki or Lokinet on Different platforms-->
CSV format is requested, but the author of this LIP defers judgment to Loki developers of what file format the data should be exported in, so long as it meets the desired functionality of this proposal.

**Rationale for this LIP**
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
This is an obviously desirable feature for the Loki wallets to have, as it meets a need of current Loki users that is currently not served in any way other way that tedious line by line data entry.

**Backwards Compatibility**
<!--All LIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The LIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. LIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.-->
To my knowledge there are no compatibility issues brought about by this proposal.


Thank You,
